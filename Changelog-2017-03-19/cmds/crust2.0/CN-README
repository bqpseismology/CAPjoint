CRUST 2.0 a global crustal model at 2 x 2 degrees

updates:
------- 
this model is a significantly updated version of CRUST 5.1.
It takes advantage of our digital sediment map that is 
defined on a 1x1 degree grid.
This new model also takes advantage of our still ongoing 
compilation of new data on crustal structure (a preliminary
version for Eurasia can be found on the anonymous ftp site
of CRUST 5.1, pub/gabi/crust).
The ice thickness in CRUST 5.1 also was adjusted to better
match the true ice thicknesses. The agreement is now to
within 250m.

We hope this model is of use in a large community
and it will grow with every feedback.


short description:
-----------------
The global crustal model uses a type key to assign crustal
structure at a 2 x 2 deg scale. Data were gathered from
seismic experiments and averaged globally for similar 
geological and tectonic settings (such as Archean,
early Proterozoic, rifts etc.). 
These averages were used to
assigned structure to regions without seismic information
(e.g. most of Africa, South America).
Ice and sediment thicknesses where gathered from published
maps. Bathymetry and topography is that of ETOPO5.
The global model is composed of 360 key 1d-profiles (the
crustal types) where one of these profiles is assigned
to each 2 x 2 degree cell.
Each individual profile is a 7 layer 1D-model with
1) ice, 2) water, 3) soft sediments, 4) hard sediments,
5) upper crust, 6) middle crust and 7) lower crust.
Parameters VP, VS and rho are given explicitly for
these 7 layers as well as the mantle below the Moho. 

the files:
---------

the model consists of three files:
a) CNevelvatio2.txt:  this is bathymetry and topography
b) CNtype2.txt:       this is the global model
c) CNtype2_key.txt: this is the file with the profiles

a) and b) are given tile by tile from -180 to 180 deg longitude
and 90 - -90 deg latitude. The first number is for the tiles
with midpoint 89N, -179E, the second one is 
89N -177E, aso, and the last one is the one with
89S, 179E.

suggested reading routine:
-------------------------

readCN2-t7.f and readCN2-7vr.f are FORTRAN code which reads
the model and give out maps of topography of the boundaries
(readCN2-t7.f) and the seismic velocities and density (readCN2-7vr.f).
The output maps are 180x90 numbers now going from 0 to 360 deg E 
(first number is at 89N, 1E!). The reading routines should
also give out some other maps such as global topography in km,   
sediment thickness, ice thickness, total crustal thickness 
(where bathymetry is included). 
REMEMBER:
Water and ice layer are flipped after this routine so that
water now is layer 1 and ice layer 2.

There will be 8 boundary maps,
the first (map.t0) is top of water, while all the others define
the bottom of the layers:
map.t1: bottom of water
map.t2: bottom of ice
map.t3: bottom of soft sediments
map.t4: bottom of hard sediments
map.t5: bottom of upper crust
map.t6: bottom of middle crust
map.t7: bottom of lower crust=MOHO.

These maps are all real topography, i.e. the depth with respect to
sea level, not with respect to the actual surface. Therefore,
map.t7 and map.thick (actual crustal thickness) are not the same!

A routine which returns the model at a given location (interactive
input) is getCN2point.f.

On a UNIX machine, don't forget to compile the code:
e.g. for getCNpoint

f77 getCNpoint.f -o getCNpoint

IMPORTANT NOTE ON THICKNESS OF THE WATER LAYER:
-----------------------------------------------

the water thicknesses given in c) are only crude estimates
and are not to be used in the model!
Routine readCN2-t7.f replaces the water thickness with the
true bathymetry (averaged to 2x2 degrees).  
Routine getCN2point returns the elevation/bathymetry. It
replaces the water thickness in the 7-layer column
by this value automatically.
The crustal thickness is the thickness of the crust
without the water layer.

if you use the anonymous ftp from there, simple save the files

new on public demand:
--------------------
there is a little fortran routine called map2gmt.
This routine asks for the name of one of the map. files.
(e.g. map.t1). The output file is a .gmt file (e.g. map.t1.gmt).
This file can be used in GMT (xyz2grd) to plot the maps.         

update Sep 7, 07:
-----------------
File crust2-maps.tar.gz has all the output maps created by the
fortran routines. The file needs to be uncompress with gunzip.
The maps can then be extracted by typing 
tar -xvf crust2-maps.tar .
